## 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce, kids' products. These constraints OVERRIDE aesthetic preference.

### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: \<page kind> for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<design system or aesthetic family>."**

### 0.C If the brief is ambiguous, do not ask [adapted]
Do not ask, even when the read is uncertain. Write the design read as one line (`판독:`) in `reports/direction.md` and proceed. [adapted]

### 0.D Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purple gradients, centered hero over dark mesh, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism on everything, infinite-loop micro-animations everywhere, Inter + slate-900. These are the LLM defaults. Reach past them deliberately based on the design read.

---

## 1. THE THREE DIALS (Core Configuration)

* **`DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`** - 1 = Perfect Symmetry, 10 = Artsy Chaos
* **`MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`** - 1 = Static, 10 = Cinematic / Physics
* **`VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`** - 1 = Art Gallery / Airy, 10 = Cockpit / Packed Data

**Baseline:** `8 / 6 / 4`. Use these unless the design read overrides them. Do not ask the user to edit this file - overrides happen conversationally.

### 1.A Dial Inference (design read → dial values)
| Signal | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| "minimalist / clean / calm / editorial / Linear-style" | 5-6 | 3-4 | 2-3 |
| "premium consumer / Apple-y / luxury / brand" | 7-8 | 5-7 | 3-4 |
| "playful / wild / Dribbble / Awwwards / experimental / agency" | 9-10 | 8-10 | 3-4 |
| "landing page / portfolio / marketing site (default)" | 7-9 | 6-8 | 3-5 |
| "trust-first / public-sector / regulated / accessibility-critical" | 3-4 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| "redesign - preserve" | match existing | +1 | match existing |
| "redesign - overhaul" | +2 | +2 | match existing |

## 3. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS

### 3.C Icons
* **Allowed libraries (priority order):** Phosphor, Hugeicons, Radix Icons, Tabler. Install the package locally or copy its SVG files into the project. Never load icons from a CDN. [adapted]
* **NEVER hand-roll SVG icons.** If a glyph is missing, install a second library or compose from primitives - do not draw icon paths from scratch.
* **One family per project.** Do not mix Phosphor with Lucide in the same component tree.

### 3.E Responsiveness & Layout Mechanics
* **Viewport Stability:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent layout jumping on mobile (iOS Safari address bar).
* **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`).

---

## 4. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)

### 4.1 Typography
* **Korean text:** fonts, size scale and line-height follow homepage-studio `references/korean.md`. The font names below are for Latin text only. [adapted]
* **SERIF DISCIPLINE (VERY DISCOURAGED AS DEFAULT):**
  * **Serif is only acceptable when ONE of these is explicitly true:**
    - The brand brief literally names a serif font, OR
    - The aesthetic family is genuinely editorial / luxury / publication / manuscript / heritage / vintage AND you can articulate why this specific serif fits this specific brand

### 4.2 Color Calibration
* Max 1 accent color. Saturation < 80% by default.
* **THE LILA RULE:** The "AI Purple / Blue glow" aesthetic is discouraged as a default. No automatic purple button glows, no random neon gradients. Use neutral bases (Zinc / Slate / Stone) with high-contrast singular accents (Emerald, Electric Blue, Deep Rose, Burnt Orange, etc.).
* **One palette per project.** Do not fluctuate between warm and cool grays within the same project.
* **PREMIUM-CONSUMER PALETTE BAN (mandatory, second-most-recurring AI-tell):**
  * For premium-consumer briefs (cookware, wellness, artisan, luxury, heritage craft, DTC home goods, etc.) the LLM default is **warm beige/cream + brass/clay/oxblood/ochre + espresso/ink dark text**. Concretely banned hex families as default backgrounds and accents:
    - Backgrounds: `#f5f1ea`, `#f7f5f1`, `#fbf8f1`, `#efeae0`, `#ece6db`, `#faf7f1`, `#e8dfcb` (all "warm paper / cream / chalk / bone")
    - Accents: `#b08947`, `#b6553a`, `#9a2436`, `#9c6e2a`, `#bc7c3a`, `#7d5621` (all "brass / clay / oxblood / ochre")
    - Text: `#1a1714`, `#1a1814`, `#1b1814` (all "espresso / warm near-black")

### 4.3 Layout Diversification
* **ANTI-CENTER BIAS:** Centered Hero / H1 sections are avoided when `DESIGN_VARIANCE > 4`. Force "Split Screen" (50/50), "Left-aligned content / right-aligned asset", "Asymmetric white-space", or scroll-pinned structures.
* **Override:** centered hero is OK for editorial / manifesto / launch-announcement briefs where the message itself is the design.

### 4.4 Materiality, Shadows, Cards
* Use cards ONLY when elevation communicates real hierarchy. Otherwise group with `border-t`, `divide-y`, or negative space.
* When a shadow is used, tint it to the background hue. No pure-black drop shadows on light backgrounds.
* **SHAPE CONSISTENCY LOCK (mandatory):** Pick ONE corner-radius scale for the page and stick to it. Options: all-sharp (radius 0), all-soft (radius 12-16px), all-pill (full radius for interactive). Mixed systems are allowed only when there is a documented rule (e.g. "buttons are full-pill, cards are 16px, inputs are 8px") and that rule is followed everywhere. Round buttons in a square layout, or square cards on a pill-button page, is broken design.

### 4.5 Interactive UI States
* **Tactile Feedback:** On `:active`, use `-translate-y-[1px]` or `scale-[0.98]` to simulate a physical push.

### 4.6 Data & Form Patterns
* Label ABOVE input. Helper text optional but present in markup. Error text BELOW input. Standard `gap-2` for input blocks.
* No placeholder-as-label. Ever.

### 4.7 Layout Discipline (Hard Rules. Failing any of these is shipping broken work)

* **EYEBROW RESTRAINT (mandatory, the #1 violated rule in production tests).** An "eyebrow" is the small uppercase wide-tracking label sitting above a section headline (e.g. `FOUR COLORWAYS`, `SELECTED WORK`, `THE HARDWARE`, `Git-native task management`). Typical CSS signature: `text-[11px] uppercase tracking-[0.18em]`, `font-mono text-[10.5px] uppercase tracking-[0.22em]`. Every AI-built site puts an eyebrow above EVERY section header, producing the same templated rhythm. Hard rule:
  - If section A has an eyebrow, the next 2 sections cannot have one.
  - **What to do instead of an eyebrow:** drop it entirely. The headline alone is enough. If you need to categorize a section, the section's location on the page already categorizes it; no label needed.

### 4.8 Image & Visual Asset Strategy

Landing pages and portfolios are **visual products**. Text-only pages with fake-screenshot divs are slop.

**Priority order for visual assets:**
1. **Image-generation tool first.** Use it to create section-specific assets (hero photography, product shots) at the right aspect ratio. Do not skip this step because hand-rolled CSS feels faster. [adapted]
2. **Input assets and generated images only.** Never hotlink or download web images (homepage-studio `references/images.md`). [adapted]

**Even minimalist sites need real images.** A pure-text page is not minimalism. It is incomplete work. Even an editorial Linear-style site needs at least 2-3 real images (hero, one product/lifestyle shot, one supporting image). Generate B&W minimalist photography if the brief is restrained; do not skip images entirely because the dial is low.

**Logo walls, testimonials and customer counts** appear only when the input provides them. [adapted]

**Hero needs a real visual.** Text + gradient blob is not a hero - it's a placeholder.

### 4.9 Content Density

* **Long lists need a different UI component, not a longer list.** Default `<ul>` with bullets / `divide-y` rows is the lazy choice. If you have > 5 items, reach for one of these instead:
  - 2-column split with grouped items
  - Card grid with image + label per item
  - Tabs / accordion if items are categorisable
  - Carousel for breadth-heavy lists (testimonials, logos, capabilities)

### 4.10 Quotes & Testimonials

Applies only when the input provides testimonials. [adapted]
* **Max 3 lines** of quote body. Never 6. If the original quote is longer → cut it. A landing-page quote is a snippet, not the full review.
* Attribution: name + role + (optionally) company. Never name only ("- Sarah").

### 4.11 Page Theme Lock (Light / Dark Mode Consistency)

The page has ONE theme. Sections do not invert.
* Default behaviour: pick light, dark, or auto (`prefers-color-scheme`) at the page level and lock it. Section-level background tints within the same theme family are fine (`bg-zinc-950` next to `bg-zinc-900`); flipping to `bg-amber-50` in the middle of a `bg-zinc-950` page is broken.

---

## 5. CONTEXT-AWARE PROACTIVITY

### 5.D Forbidden Animation Patterns

* **`window.addEventListener("scroll", ...)`** is banned. It runs on every scroll frame, jank-prone, no batching. Use Motion's `useScroll()`, GSAP's `ScrollTrigger`, IntersectionObserver, or CSS `scroll-driven animations` (`animation-timeline: view()`).

---

## 6. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY GUARDRAILS

### 6.B Reduced Motion (mandatory)
* **Any motion above `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3` MUST honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** This is non-negotiable.
* In CSS: gate animations behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide an override block under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` that disables.
* Infinite loops, parallax, scroll-hijack, and magnetic physics MUST collapse to static / instant under reduced motion.
* Hidden initial states apply only when JS has run and `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference` matches, so content is visible without JS (homepage-studio `references/motion.md`). [adapted]

### 6.C Dark Mode (only on request) [adapted]
* Only when the input or brand asks for it. Otherwise ship one theme. Section 4.11 Theme Lock applies either way. [adapted]

### 6.D Core Web Vitals Targets
* **LCP** < 2.5s. Preload the hero image (or give it `fetchpriority="high"`). [adapted]
* **INP** < 200ms. Heavy work off main thread.
* **CLS** < 0.1. Reserve space for images, fonts, embeds.

---

## 7. DIAL DEFINITIONS (Technical Reference)

### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Symmetrical CSS Grid (12-col, equal fr-units), equal paddings, centered alignment.
* **4-7 (Offset):** `margin-top: -2rem` overlaps, varied image aspect ratios (4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (`grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`).
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, asymmetric layouts above `md:` MUST collapse to strict single-column (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px`.

### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only. `prefers-reduced-motion` is the default mode anyway.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus on `transform` and `opacity`.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals, parallax, scroll-driven animation (CSS `animation-timeline` or GSAP ScrollTrigger). Scroll listeners are banned (Section 5.D). [adapted]

### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps (`py-32` to `py-48`). Expensive, clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App):** Standard web app spacing (`py-16` to `py-24`).

## 9. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)

Avoid these signatures unless the brief explicitly asks for them.

### 9.A Visual & CSS
* **NO neon / outer glows** by default. Use inner borders or subtle tinted shadows.
* **NO pure black (`#000000`).** Off-black, zinc-950, or charcoal.
* **NO oversaturated accents.** Desaturate to blend with neutrals.
* **NO excessive gradient text** for large headers.
* **NO custom mouse cursors.** Outdated, accessibility-hostile, perf-hostile.

### 9.B Typography
* **NO oversized H1s** that just scream. Control hierarchy with weight + color, not raw scale.
* **Serif constraints:** Serif for editorial / luxury / publication. Not for dashboards.

### 9.C Layout & Spacing
* **NO 3-column equal feature cards.** The generic "three identical cards horizontally" feature row is banned. Use 2-column zig-zag, asymmetric grid, scroll-pinned, or horizontal-scroll alternative.

### 9.D Content & Data ("Jane Doe" Effect)
* **NO invented names, people, brands or numbers.** They come only from the input. Avoid fake-perfect figures (`99.99%`, `1234567`) even as decoration. [adapted]

### 9.E External Resources & Components
* **NO hand-rolled SVG icons.** Use Phosphor / HugeIcons / Radix / Tabler. Lucide on explicit request only.
* **Hand-rolled decorative SVGs strongly discouraged** as default (see Section 4.8).
* **NO div-based fake screenshots.** Never build a fake product UI out of `<div>` rectangles to simulate a screenshot. Use real images, generated images, or skip the preview.

### 9.F Production-Test Tells (banned outright)

**Section numbering & micro-labels**
* **NO section-number eyebrows.** `00 / INDEX`, `001 · Capabilities`, `002 · Featured commission`, `06 · how it works`, `05 · The honest table` - banned. Eyebrows should name the topic in plain language, not enumerate.

**Marketing-copy Tells**
* **NO micro-meta-sentences under eyebrows.** Sentences like *"Each of these is a feature we ship today, not a roadmap promise. The list will stay short on purpose."* sitting under a section heading are clutter. Eyebrow + Headline + Body is enough.
* **NO generic step labels.** "Stage 1 / Stage 2 / Stage 3", "Step 1 / Step 2 / Step 3", "Phase 01 / Phase 02 / Phase 03", "Pass One / Pass Two / Pass Three". Banned. The actual step content is the label. If you must show progression, use the verb-noun directly ("Install", "Configure", "Ship") not "Stage 1: Install".

**Pills, labels and version stamps**
* **NO pills/labels/tags overlaid on images.** No `<span>` overlays on photos with tags like `Brand · 02`, `PLATE · BRAND`, `Field notes - journal`. Either let the image speak alone, or add a caption directly below (outside the image).
* **NO photo-credit captions as decoration.** Strings like `Field study no. 12 · Ines Caetano`, `Plate 03 · House archive`, `Frame XII · 35mm` under stock/picsum images are pretentious. Photo credit is allowed ONLY when there is a real photographer being credited for a real photo (with permission). Otherwise: skip the caption or use a one-line functional caption ("The 6-quart, in Sage.").

**Decoration text strips**
* **NO decoration text strip at hero bottom.** Patterns like `BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.`, `TYPE / FORM / MOTION`, `DESIGN · BUILD · SHIP`, `ESTD. 2018 · LISBON · BRAND. MOTION. SPATIAL.` as a small mono-caps strip across the bottom of the hero are an agency-portfolio cliché. Banned by default. Only acceptable when the strip carries real, navigable links (sticky bottom nav) or real status info (cookie banner, build info on a docs site).
* **NO floating top-right sub-text in section headings.** Pattern: section has a giant left-aligned headline; in the top-right corner of the same section header there is a small explainer paragraph floating with no clear alignment to anything else. That floater is the Tell. Either put the sub-text directly under the headline, or build a clean 2-column header (left: headline, right: aligned body), but not a tiny corner paragraph.

**Lists, dividers and scoring**
* **NO `border-t` + `border-b` on every row of a long list / spec table.** Pick one (bottom-border between rows OR top-border above the group) and use it sparsely. A 10-row spec table with hairlines under each row is the laziest layout - see Section 4.9 for alternative UI components.

**Locale, time, scroll cues**
* **Locale / city-name / time / weather strips are banned for 99% of briefs.** "Lisbon, working with founders" in the hero, "1200-690 Lisbon, Portugal" in the footer, "Lisbon 14:23 · 18°C" in the nav. These are agency-portfolio decoration tells. Allowed ONLY when: the brief explicitly describes a globally-distributed studio with timezone-relevant work, OR a travel-focused brand, OR a real-world physical venue. A single contact-address mention in the footer is fine; an atmospheric locale strip is not.
* **Scroll cues are banned.** `Scroll`, `↓ scroll`, `Scroll to explore`, `Scroll to walk through it`, animated mouse-wheel icons. If the user has not scrolled yet, they are looking at the hero. They know what scroll is. The bottom of the viewport does not need a label.
* **ZERO decorative status dots by default.** A coloured dot before nav items, before list rows, before badges, before status labels is a Tell. Only acceptable when conveying real semantic state (a live indicator on actual server status, a live availability flag) and limited to one per page section.

### 9.G EM-DASH BAN (the single most-violated Tell)

**Em-dash (`—`) is COMPLETELY banned.** It is the LLM's signature stylistic crutch and it is the #1 visual Tell in production tests. There is no "limited use" allowance, no "natural language frequency" allowance, no "in body copy is fine" allowance. None.

* **Banned in headlines.** Use a period or a comma.
* **Banned in eyebrows / labels / pills / button text / image captions / nav items.** Replace with line breaks, columns, or hairlines.
* **Banned in body copy.** Restructure the sentence: two sentences with a period, OR a comma, OR parentheses, OR a colon.
* **Banned in quote attribution.** Use a normal hyphen with spaces (` - `) or a line break + smaller-weight name.
* **Banned in en-dash form too (`–`) when used as a separator.** Date ranges (`2018-2026`) use a hyphen. Number ranges (`€40-80k`) use a hyphen.
* **Banned in Korean copy too.** The same rules apply to every Korean string on the page. [adapted]

The ONLY permitted dash characters on the page are:
* Regular hyphen `-` (for compound words, ranges, line dividers in markup)
* Minus sign in math (`-5°C`)

If your output contains a single `—` or `–` anywhere visible to the user, the output fails the Pre-Flight Check and must be rewritten.

---

## 11. REDESIGN PROTOCOL

### 11.C Preservation Rules
Applies when a feedback run changes the existing page. [adapted]
* **Do not change information architecture** unless asked. Keep page slugs, anchor IDs, primary nav labels stable for SEO and muscle memory.
* **Honor existing accessibility wins.** Do not regress focus states, alt text, keyboard nav, contrast.

---

## 14. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

In build-out look rounds, judge the screenshots with this check. Round limits follow homepage-studio. Mark comparisons with a previous project "cannot verify" and do not look up other runs. Mark items for elements the page does not have (bento, testimonials, forms) "not applicable"; do not add content to pass. [adapted]
- [ ] **Brief inference** declared (Section 0.B one-liner)?
- [ ] **Dial values** explicit and reasoned from the brief, not silently using baseline?
- [ ] **ZERO em-dashes (`—`) anywhere on the page.** Headlines, eyebrows, pills, body, quotes, attribution, captions, buttons, alt text. Zero. (Section 9.G - non-negotiable.)
- [ ] **Shape Consistency Lock**: one corner-radius system applied consistently (Section 4.4)?
- [ ] **Button Contrast Check**: every CTA text is readable against its background (no white-on-white, WCAG AA 4.5:1)?
- [ ] **CTA Button Wrap**: no CTA label wraps to 2+ lines at desktop?
- [ ] **Form Contrast Check**: form inputs, placeholders, focus rings, labels all pass WCAG AA against the section background?
- [ ] **Serif discipline**: if a serif is used, it is NOT Fraunces or Instrument_Serif (or it is, with explicit brand justification)? Different serif from your previous project?
- [ ] **Premium-consumer palette check**: if the brief is premium-consumer (cookware / wellness / artisan / luxury), the palette is NOT the AI-default beige+brass+oxblood+espresso family? Different family from your previous premium-consumer project?
- [ ] **Hero fits the viewport**: headline ≤ 2 lines, subtext ≤ 20 words AND ≤ 4 lines, CTA visible without scroll, font scale planned around image?
- [ ] **Hero top padding**: max `pt-24` at desktop, hero content does not float halfway down the viewport?
- [ ] **Hero stack discipline**: max 4 text elements in hero (eyebrow OR brand strip, headline, subtext, CTAs)? No tiny tagline below CTAs, no trust micro-strip in hero?
- [ ] **EYEBROW COUNT (mechanical)**: count instances of `uppercase tracking` micro-labels above section headlines across all components. Count ≤ ceil(sectionCount / 3)? Hero counts as 1.
- [ ] **Split-Header Ban**: no "left big headline + right small explainer paragraph" pattern as a section header (vertical stack instead)?
- [ ] **Zigzag Alternation Cap**: no 3+ consecutive sections with the same image+text-split layout?
- [ ] **CTA label consistency**: one label per intent; the same CTA may repeat in nav, hero and footer. [adapted]
- [ ] **Bento Background Diversity**: at least 2-3 bento cells have real visual variation (image, gradient, pattern), not all white-on-white text cards?
- [ ] **Copy Self-Audit**: every visible string re-read, no grammatically-broken or AI-hallucinated phrases ("free on its past" type) shipped?
- [ ] **Motion motivated**: every animation can be justified in one sentence (hierarchy / storytelling / feedback / state transition), no GSAP-for-show?
- [ ] **Marquee max-one-per-page**: no two horizontal marquees on the same page?
- [ ] **Navigation on ONE line** at desktop, height ≤ 80px?
- [ ] **Section-Layout-Repetition** check: no two sections share the same layout family (at least 4 different families across 8 sections)?
- [ ] **Bento has rhythm AND exact cell count** (N items → N cells, no empty cells in middle or at end)?
- [ ] **Every Section 9.F tell** checked on the screenshots (section numbers, step labels, micro-meta, image overlays, photo credits, hero strips, scroll cues, dots)? [adapted]
- [ ] **Content density** sane: no 20-row data tables, no fake-precise specs without justification, ≤ 25-word sub-paragraphs by default?
- [ ] **Motion claimed = motion shown**: if `MOTION_INTENSITY > 4`, page actually animates, not just claimed?
- [ ] **Empty / loading / error** states provided?
- [ ] **No AI Tells** from Section 9 (Inter as default, AI-purple, three-equal cards, Jane Doe, Acme, "Quietly in use at")?
